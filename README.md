# eTipMaster-in-Python
eTipMaster, will calculate a tip that a dinner party has to pay at an expensive restaurant, and then write to a file the inputs, intermediate calculations, and the actual tip amount payed for the dinner. First, the user, a restaurant worker, will input either a password ("Shut%Down123") to terminate the program for the night or signal that there is another party whose tip needs to be calculated. The user then records the number of guests in the party, what floor of the restaurant that they dined on, what the cost of the meal was without the tip, and how many cocktails were ordered. From there, the program uses several custom functions to calculate the individual components of the tip, the total, and final sum (the tip that must be payed). While the party is giving their inputs and the total tip is being calculated, the program will write the data to a file. In total, each line of the data file should have nine data points of either type integer or float (number of guests, floor number, meal cost, number of cocktails, headcount tip, floor tip, alcohol discount, total, and final tip payed).
